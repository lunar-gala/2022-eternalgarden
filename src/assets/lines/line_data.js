Folktale is a structure which can change and mold its shape throughout time.  The line visually represents this by creating a pattern emblematic of a carbon structure which can take on many different forms while preserving its substance.',

As it blooms, a flower signifies a start of a new season, life, and cycle of nature. It possesses so much potential for growth in itself that the mere beauty of a flower is no longer its most significant feature. For this line, by capturing an image of the flower Lotus, we wanted to insinuate our desires and passions for learning and doing art. In order to make this signification of growth more personal, we associated the affinity of lotus to its Asian cultures.',

There is a tension between mermaids and sea witches, a tension between the beautiful and the ugly, the young and the old, the innocent and the omniscient.  Using largely second hand materials and found objects, the likes of which one might find in a lair or lagoon, I set out to capture this mythic relationship.  In my collection, I pay tribute to these wondrous creatures that represent the unknown.',

In our line, we explore the transitions through different phases of our adolescence and the fears associated with each period. During each stage, these fears consume us, affecting aspects of our life that are untouched by it today. These anxieties slowly mold us into the people we become.',

Are we able to extend the identity of an organism by weaving its evanescing(ephemeral) longevity into the temporary presence?<br /><br /> Botanic material was chosen to be the retention device that imprints its formal characteristics onto garments. Translated by the technicity of chemical and heat, the transitory memory and identity can be molded and recollected within their trace on textile.<br /><br /> Once the immeasurable relic of time is captured, preserved, and eternalized, an ambivalent intimacy emerges within the thinning threshold between body, garment, and memory.

There is a part of us that searches for many aspects in life that captures our interest, but oftentimes, getting caught in all these visions of yourself leads to a state of disorientation. The growth of youth includes the messy discovery of self image, where at one point it almost becomes unrecognizable. However as we continue to evolve between the juxtaposition of curiosity and confusion, there comes a point where we finally come to an acceptance of ourselves in a unity through the morphing of different identities. The series takes on a three-dimensional and sculptural approach, inspired by fluidity and the morphing of spheroid geometries.',
