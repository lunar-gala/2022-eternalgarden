      "Experiri is about experiencing the world through clothing. We use varied textures, concepts that excite and represent the senses, and materials that allow for and encourage interactivity with one’s environment. Play and comfort dominate our designs, which are meant to be worn not only on a runway, but also outside! Feel movement or change details while thinking about the ways our senses allow us to interpret what's going on around us.",

      'Morphosis channels the essence of storytelling and oral tradition and its inherent youth.  As folktales get passed down through generations, they go through the process of a rebirth each time they are recounted because each individual will tell the story in their own unique way.  Folktale is a structure which can change and mold its shape throughout time.  The line visually represents this by creating a pattern emblematic of a carbon structure which can take on many different forms while preserving its substance.',

      'The female experience of period deserves to be known - it is rich and dynamic, varying with time and individuals. Sometimes it can be painful, other times it might be fun. It should always be considered a beautiful symbol of maturity and life. My line aims to bring up discussion on the topic that is sometimes avoided, to educate whoever is unfamiliar or has bias about period, and to empower women by assuring ourselves of the pride we take and the possibilities we see in our female identity.',

I sat for a long while, then crawled deeper, molded my body to the Earth, and fell asleep.<br /><br />Imagine you are a rock, witnessing this moment<br />and many moments before and many moments after. <br />You learn to be one with the flies.<br /><br />III. <br />‘Imagine the last time you cared for someone who was sick, or they cared for you.’<br /><br />Mine:<br />I walked with these beings, <br />To Reno, to Pluto,<br />And they hummed soft sounds and they brushed my hair and they rubbed ointment on my lips.<br /><br />IV.

      'An object that captures out line is a flower. it is not the beauty of this object that we are interested in, but the potential of burst of energy that a flower possesses. As it blooms, a flower signifies a start of a new season, life, and cycle of nature. It possesses so much potential for growth in itself that the mere beauty of a flower is no longer its most significant feature. For this line, by capturing an image of the flower Lotus, we wanted to insinuate our desires and passions for learning and doing art. In order to make this signification of growth more personal, we associated the affinity of lotus to its Asian cultures.',

      'Serpentine tails, wispy fingers, twisting torsos, billowing hair.  I have always been fascinated by mermaids.  There is a tension between mermaids and sea witches, a tension between the beautiful and the ugly, the young and the old, the innocent and the omniscient.  Using largely second hand materials and found objects, the likes of which one might find in a lair or lagoon, I set out to capture this mythic relationship.  In my collection, I pay tribute to these wondrous creatures that represent the unknown.',

      'What’s more scary than the years of our youth? Youth is filled with an abundance of fears. From the monsters under our beds to the pressures of becoming a successful member of society, the stages of our early life are filled with worries and uncertainties. In our line, we explore the transitions through different phases of our adolescence and the fears associated with each period. During each stage, these fears consume us, affecting aspects of our life that are untouched by it today. These anxieties slowly mold us into the people we become.',

      'EVANESCENS seeks to construct a commoning territory between garments and memory. Embracing the ephemerality of youth under the irretrievable directionality of time, the collection is a study on the juxtaposition of weathering and retention of organic matter.<br /><br /> The aging of organisms can be understood as the erosion process by incrementing entropy. Are we able to extend the identity of an organism by weaving its evanescing(ephemeral) longevity into the temporary presence?<br /><br /> Botanic material was chosen to be the retention device that imprints its formal characteristics onto garments. Translated by the technicity of chemical and heat, the transitory memory and identity can be molded and recollected within their trace on textile.<br /><br /> Once the immeasurable relic of time is captured, preserved, and eternalized, an ambivalent intimacy emerges within the thinning threshold between body, garment, and memory.

      'Monachopsis: “n. the subtle but persistent feeling of being out of place, as maladapted to your surroundings as a seal on a beach….unable to recognize the ambient roar of your intended habitat”. There is a part of us that searches for many aspects in life that captures our interest, but oftentimes, getting caught in all these visions of yourself leads to a state of disorientation. The growth of youth includes the messy discovery of self image, where at one point it almost becomes unrecognizable. However as we continue to evolve between the juxtaposition of curiosity and confusion, there comes a point where we finally come to an acceptance of ourselves in a unity through the morphing of different identities. The series takes on a three-dimensional and sculptural approach, inspired by fluidity and the morphing of spheroid geometries.',
